                <h2>Here's a time line of Chattarpati Shivaji Maharaj :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1627</strong>- Born in Shivneri, Pune</li>
                    <li>Shivaji's paternal grandfather Maloji<strong> (1552–1597) </strong>was an influential general of Ahmadnagar
                        Sultanate</li>
                    <li> Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates</li>

                    <li>Shivaji was named after a local deity, the<strong> god Shiva</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Shivaji was devoted to his mother Jijabai, who was deeply religious. His studies of the Hindu
                        epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, also influenced his lifelong defence of Hindu values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Many of<strong> Shivaji's comrades</strong>, and later a number of his soldiers, came from the Maval region,
                        including <strong>Yesaji Kank</strong>,<strong> Suryaji Kakade</strong>,<strong> Baji Pasalkar</strong>, <strong>Baji Prabhu Deshpande </strong>and <strong>Tanaji Malusare</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Shivaji traveled the hills and forests of the Sahyadri range with his Maval friends, gaining
                        skills and familiarity with the land that would prove useful in his military career.</li>
                    <li><strong> November 1659</strong>: Shivaji Killed Afzal Khan, general of Bijapur.</li>
                    <li><strong>1659</strong>: Siege of Panhala. Shivaji wins.</li>
                    <li>Conflict with the Mughals: when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near
                        Ahmednagar</li>
                    <li>Attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat. Shivaji launched a surprised attack on Shaista Khan in Pune.
                        Shivaji wins.</li>
                    <li>Treaty of Purandar<strong> (1665)</strong>: signed between Shivaji and Jai Singh on 11 June 1665, Shivaji agreed
                        to give up 23 of his forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay compensation of 400,000 gold hun to
                        the Mughals.</li>
                    <li>Arrest in Agra and escape: In 1666 Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra along with his
                        nine-year-old son Sambhaji and make him house arrest. SHivaji somehow managed to escape from
                        that fort by smuggling himself along with his son in the basket.</li>
                    <li>Reconquest: Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and recovered a major portion of
                        the territories surrendered to them in a span of four months.</li>
                    <li>In late March<strong> 1680</strong>, Shivaji fell ill with fever dying around <strong>3–5 April 1680 </strong>at the age of<strong> 52</strong>, on
                        the eve of Hanuman Jayanti.</li>
                    <li>He also took the title of <strong>Haindava Dharmodhhaarak</strong> (protector of the Hindu faith).</li>
                    
                    <p class="quote"><em>Shivaji was admired for his heroic exploits and clever stratagems in the contemporary
                            accounts of English, French, Dutch, Portuguese and Italian writers. Contemporary English
                            writers compared him with Alexander, Hannibal and Julius Caesar. Muslim writers of the day
                            generally described him as a plunderer and marauder. Shivaji didn't loot, he plundered
                            Mughals.</em></p>
